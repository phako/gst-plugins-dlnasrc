WHAT IT IS
----------

dtcpip is a filter type component which will decrypt DTCP/IP encrypted content retrieved via HTTP GET from a DLNA (Digital Living Network Allicance) DMS (Digital Media Server).

This element utilizes DTCP/IP keys and a shared library which is loaded at runtime which performs the key exchange and decryption.  The following environment variables specify the location of the keys and shared library:
RUIH_GST_DTCP_KEY_STORAGE - directory containing keys, should end with /
RUIH_GST_DTCP_DLL - name including directory path to shared library to load 

DTCP/IP decryption can be disabled in which this element would just act as a passthrough by defining the following env var:
RUIH_GST_DTCP_DISABLE

In order to facilitate testing with Tru2Way OCAP RI DMS, this element can be configured through env vars to use a "mock" dll.  This "mock" dll has stubs for decryption methods and does no actual key exchange or decryption.  The "mock" library can only be used with an Tru2Way OCAP RI DMS which is also configured to use a "mock" library.  The mock *.so is checked into the test subdirectory. 

For use on the RUIH project, this element is not intended to be autoplugged by playbin, but rather to be included and managed by the dlnasrc element.

HOW TO BUILD IT
---------------
Issue the following commands from the dtcpip directory:
./autogen.sh

This will produce a Makefile, initiate the make via:
make

Install the plugin via:
sudo make install

This plugin will be built when entering the same commands from gst-plugins-cl (parent directory)
